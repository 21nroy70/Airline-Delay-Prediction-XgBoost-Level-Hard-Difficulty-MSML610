#  Pseudocode of what my thought process is in terms of creating this file -> this my next thing now

# EDA for airline delay dataset.
# - Loads parquet -> pandas
# - Coerces types, derives simple time features
# - Writes summary CSVs to reports/tables/
# - Writes figures to reports/figures/
# - --show true also writes reports/EDA_report.html
#   If running inside IPython (same kernel), it will display inline.
