# ADP Core Interfaces (Contract)

Here, I will be adding stuff about the adp layers like talking about my features, model, and such about the code This file documents the stable contract layer for the project without pulling in runtime specifics.


## Modules
- `adp.core.io` — abstract interfaces for flights & weather sources
- `adp.core.features` — abstract feature/label builder
- `adp.core.model` — abstract model service

This help gives whoever decides to execute and look at my program/files a way to integrate with my pipeline
